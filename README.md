This is a little remastered version of another of my game made using Unity, which I created as a study project.

NOTE: Only available has a portfolio game and isn't recommended to be played has a complete game.

<b>Developed:</b> 2017.

The game is a turn-based puzzle game with a big influence on GO franchise by Square Enix (Lara Croft GO, Hitman GO and Deus Ex Go). Was developed on a month when I was a student has a solo developer.

On this prototype I was exploring the way to do a gameplay tutorial on the main menu, inspired on how Mario Bros teach us how to play in his first level.
